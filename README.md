# Castles
Color coded bar chart of 10 random heights<br>
Color coded uphill slopes, downhill slopes and plateaus<br>
We build 1 "Castle" for each non-slope/plateau height<br>
## Assumptions
The rightmost item could be considered undefined, like the leftmost item, since there would presumably be more data to the left and right.
## To Run
All files in same folder, click on index.html<br>
"Randomise" refreshes with random data
